## Introduction
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD is an open-source database that includes information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017 and with over 181,000 records and 135 attributes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### A. Temporal Attributes

#### i. Year
Analyze trends over time to understand how terrorism has evolved.

#### ii. Month
Examine seasonal patterns in terrorist activities.

#### iii. Day
Look for specific days with the highest incidents.

### B. Geographical Attributes

#### i. Country
Identify countries with the highest number of incidents.

#### ii. Region
Understand regional patterns and hotspots.

#### iii. Province/State
Drill down to more specific locations within countries.

#### iv. Latitude and Longitude
Map the incidents for spatial analysis.

### C. Incidents Characteristics

#### i. Primary Attack Type
Determine the most common types of attack.

#### ii. Secondary Attack Type
Analyze the combination of attack types.

#### iii. Success
Evaluate the success rate of attacks.

#### iv. Suicide
Understand the prevalence of suicide attacks (1=Yes, 0=No).

#### v. Extended
Investigate incidents lasting more than 24 hours (1=Yes, 0=No).

### D. Target and Victim Information

#### i. Primary Target Type
Identify common targets of attacks.

#### ii. Target Entity
Details of specific target entities.

#### iii. Number of Fatalities
Analyze the human cost of terrorism.

#### iv. Number of Injuries
Assess the impact on victims.

#### v. Number of Hostages/Kidnapping Victims
Examine incidents involving hostages.

### E. Perpetrator Information

#### i. Perpetrator Group
Identify groups responsible for the most incidents.

#### ii. Individual
Look into incidents carried out by individuals (1=Yes, 0=No).

#### iii. Number of Perpetrators
Analyze the group size involved in incidents.

### F. Weapon Information

#### i. Primary Weapon Type
Determine the most commonly used weapons.

#### ii. Primary Weapon Subtype
Further detail on weaponry.

### G. Property and Economic Impact

#### i. Property Damage
Incidents involving property damage.

#### ii. Value of Property Damaged
Financial cost of incidents.

### H. Additional Context

#### i. Motive
Explore the motives behind the attacks.

#### ii. Claimed
Understand if incidents were claimed by groups.

#### iii. Ransom
Investigate incidents involving ransom demands.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) for providing me with the invaluable opportunity to undertake an internship project on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Global Terrorism. This experience has been incredibly enriching and has significantly contributed to my professional and personal growth.

I am particularly thankful for the support and guidance provided by the mentors and coordinators throughout the internship. Their expertise and insights have been instrumental in helping me navigate the complexities of the project and in enhancing my understanding of data analysis and its real-world applications.

This internship has not only allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in a practical setting but has also provided me with a deeper understanding of the global terrorism landscape through data-driven insights. The skills and experiences I have gained during this project will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future endeavors.
